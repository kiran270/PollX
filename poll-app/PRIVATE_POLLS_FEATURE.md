# Private Polls Feature

## Overview
Polls can now be created as either **Public** or **Private**, giving you control over poll visibility.

## Public vs Private Polls

### Public Polls (Default)
- ✅ Visible in the main poll listings
- ✅ Searchable by all users
- ✅ Anyone can discover and vote
- ✅ Shown in category filters

### Private Polls
- 🔒 **Only accessible via direct link**
- 🔒 Not shown in public listings
- 🔒 Not searchable
- 🔒 Perfect for sharing with specific groups
- ✅ Anyone with the link can view and vote

## How to Create a Private Poll

1. Go to **Create Poll** page
2. Fill in your poll details
3. Toggle the **Public Poll** switch to OFF (it will turn amber and say "Private Poll")
4. Complete and submit your poll
5. You'll receive a shareable link - copy it and share with your intended audience

## Visual Indicators

Private polls display a 🔒 **Private** badge:
- On the poll card in listings (if you're viewing your own polls)
- On the poll detail page

## Sharing Private Polls

When you create a private poll, you'll get a popup with:
- The direct link to your poll
- Option to copy the link to clipboard
- Share this link via email, messaging apps, or any other method

You can also use the share button on any poll to:
- Share on social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp)
- Copy the link to clipboard

## Editing Poll Visibility

Admins can change a poll from public to private (or vice versa) by:
1. Clicking the edit button on the poll
2. Toggling the Public/Private switch
3. Saving changes

## Use Cases for Private Polls

- Internal team surveys
- Private group decisions
- Exclusive community polls
- Testing polls before making them public
- Sensitive topics requiring controlled access
- Event-specific polls shared only with attendees

## Security Note

Private polls are not password-protected. Anyone with the direct link can access and vote on the poll. The privacy comes from the link not being publicly discoverable.
